 * @brief Computes the absolute delta of each element in a buffer from a center value.
 *
 * Optimized for buffer sizes that are integer multiples of 8. For example, if a center
 * value of 127U is provided, the absolute delta is computed as:
 *
 * @code
 * value = value > 127U ? value - 127U : 127U - value;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param[in,out] buffer Pointer to the buffer to process. The result is stored in the same buffer.
 * @param[in] size Number of elements in the buffer to process.
 * @param[in] center_pack The center value to compute the absolute delta.
